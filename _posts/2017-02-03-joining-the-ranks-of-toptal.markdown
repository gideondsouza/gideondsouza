So I've spent a whole lot of my life programming. Been at it since I was 11. I'm 26 so that's more than half my life.

I've worked both as a freelancer and in a 9-5 jobs. My current job is where I've been for 5 years now.

I've found out over the time I've spent programming that it's a whole large field out there that moves  
ridiculously fast. As a programmer you need to keep updated with what's out there by diving into new things. A freelancing position gives you the opportunity to do this but a 9-5 job might not. 

Open source provides for an amazing opportunity to showcase skill and work with others, but I've also got bills to pay?

Recently I noticed online freelance portals provide something of a win-win. Is gives you money, some independence and the ability to work with what you want.

I'm giving Toptal a chance and I'll see how it all goes. So far their questionnaire seems quite interesting, they seem to be looking out for the nerd and that makes me happy.

I'll keep you updated.
